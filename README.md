# Steepest Gradient Descent

Steepest Gradient Descent is the most important algorithm used when training a Neural Network using Back Propagation (a close brethren to this is Stochastic Gradient Descent in Batch which is more commonly used). Thus it is very useful to understand the Maths behind this simple but powerful algorithm which can be used in N dimensions.
